# Instructions
Note that this exercise needs the setup from the demonstration.

0. Create `my_ip.c` in `pulp-runtime/drivers`. This the
   implementation file of the driver.
1. Create `my_ip.h` in `pulp-runtime/include`. Expose the
   correct declarations.
2. Add the necessary glue code to `pulpissimo.mk` and `include/pulp.h` to make
   compilation flow work (`make all`)
3. Try to pass the tests
